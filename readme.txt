This is a mod that turns the protagonist of quake into a wizard! Sling spells while leveling up through the original game's story! 
After using your spells a certain amount of time, you will gain mastery of them, and unlock the next spell. 
The five(*) utility spells and five summon spells will also be gated by level. 
These use keys f-k and t-o repsectively. 
You must have fun! I require it!
